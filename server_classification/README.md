##Overview

This is for using the trained-well model for classifying the images. Unlike the Caffe that we used before, it's testing while training
in different iterations. Now, we need to write a script for using python interface of Caffe, to load the model and use it for predicting
the category of the images.

This project is not like the RESTful Web Service that deployed in the server, even though they're all server-side program, their role is
quite different.
